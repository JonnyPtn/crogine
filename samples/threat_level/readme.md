Crogine desktop test application
--------------------------------

This project creates an application designed to test the crogine library (contained in /common). The 'testwin' title is a misnomer as development started on windows, as this project should compile on all common desktop environments, Windows, linux and MacOS via the cmake file. The android build of crogin and associated test application in mainted in a separate project.

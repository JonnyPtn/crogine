Golf!
-----

A retro-styled golf game. Currently featuring up to 4 local players (per client) and 4 clients per network game for a theoretical 16 player round of golf. The game is based on more traditional rules, and is therefore turn-based.

Limited player customisation is implemented, as well as most game play (it's possible to play an entire game) although menus are WIP with limited options outside the console, as well as only a single course avaiable.

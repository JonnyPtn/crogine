Super Video Golf!
-----------------

A retro-styled golf game. Currently featuring up to 4 local players (per client) and 4 clients per network game for a theoretical 16 player round of golf. The game is based on more traditional rules, and is therefore turn-based.

Downloads can be found on http://fallahn.itch.io/vga-golf and it can be built from source. A rudimentary mod kit is included in the repository for creating custom balls and courses.

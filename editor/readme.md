CROGINE World Editor, Model Converter and Material Editor (WIP)
---------------------------------------------------------------

World Editor allows importing models into a scene and placing them in world space. Current plan is only for geometry layout - gameplay programming is still required in code.

Model Converter allows opening and importing model files for conversion to the crogine model format, as well as displaying data such as material info and animation data. See `cro_mesh_format.md` for details on the mesh file format, and `model_definition_format.md` for examples on authoring model definition files.

Material Editor is designed for fast preview and easy reuse of material definitions which can be applied to models loaded in the model converter/viewer.

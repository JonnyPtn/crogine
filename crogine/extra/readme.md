Extras
------

This folder contains some extra component and system classes which are often useful additions to projects but don't necessarily qualify for inclusion in the main library. To use these in a project simply copy the source files to your project directory and add them to your list of files to compile. Some of these classes, such as the `CollisionSystem` depend on third party libraries, in this particular instance [Bullet Physics](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3). More information about each of the classes can be found in the comments of their  respective header files.

The VAT (Vertex Animation Texture) export script samples the active animation on the active selection and exports the animation data as a set of PNG images, for vertex position, vertex normal and optionally vertex tangents. NOTE that images produced are as wide in pixels as there are vertices in a model - so a model with 27K vertices will produce a text 27K pixels wide!! You have been warned ;) Images have one row of pixels for each sampled frame, so even a few hundred frames of animation should be OK. It's also possible to set the frame skip value in the export options to only sample every Nth frame.

More complex models mean that the script may take longer to run, causing Blender to apparently hang - in these cases be patient and let it run until Blender becomes responsive again.

The export script is based on a video by Martin Donald which can be found here:

There is a crogine specific implementation in the 'scratchpad' project.
